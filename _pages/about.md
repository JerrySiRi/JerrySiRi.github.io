Hi there! This is Rui Shi, and welcome to my personal corner „Éæ(‡πë‚ïπ‚ó°‚ïπ)Ôæâ"! I love sharing my thoughts on AI‚Äîespecially large language models‚Äîso grab a cup of coffee and have fun exploring! I‚Äôm currently an LLM Algorithm Research Intern @Kuaishou Technology, fresh off earning my Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence from Nanjing University under the guidance of Prof. [Cunjing Ge](https://gecunjing.github.io) and Prof. [Yizheng Zhao](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zhaoyizheng/).

During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to dive into AI research as an research intern @Yale University, Department of Biomedical Informatics & Data Science with Prof. [Hua Xu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/), and @Shanghai AI Lab with Prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io).

My research passions center on **Safe Guaranteed AI**, especially through  *Natural Language Processing* and *Deep Reinforcement Learning* techniques. I‚Äôm also fascinated by *Diffusion LLMs* and *Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning*, and I firmly believe these alternative non‚Äëautoregressive approaches hold real promise on the road to AGI!


# Recent News 
1. [2025.9.27] Our paper ["Impact of Context on Large Language Models for Clinical Named Entity Recognition"](http://jerrysiri.github.io/files/Impact_of_Context.pdf) was accepted by *AMIA 2025 Annual Symposium* as a Late Breaking Poster!
2. [2025.8.12] I will be working with Prof. [Ning Miao](https://www.ningmiao.space) as a research assistant at City University of Hong Kong on October 2, working on *LLM reasoning with reinforcement learning* and *next-generation LLM frameworks*! (Since my visa was held up in security screening, I had to take a gap year.) Excite to contribute more truly valuable and solid work ‚ù§Ô∏è!
