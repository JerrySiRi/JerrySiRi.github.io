Hi there! I’m Rui Shi, and welcome to my personal corner! I love sharing my thoughts on AI—especially large language models—so grab a cup of coffee and have fun exploring! I’m currently an LLM Algorithm Research Intern @Kuaishou Technology, fresh off earning my Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence from Nanjing University under the guidance of Prof. [Cunjing Ge](https://gecunjing.github.io) and Prof. [Yizheng Zhao](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/zhaoyizheng/).

During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to dive into AI research as an research intern @Yale University’s Department of Biomedical Informatics & Data Science with Prof. [Hua Xu](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/hua-xu/), and @Shanghai AI Lab with Prof. [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io).

My research passions center on **Natural Language Processing** and **Reinforcement Learning**, especially on RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards). I’m particularly fascinated by **Diffusion LLMs** and **Knowledge Representation & Processing**, and I firmly believe these alternative non‑autoregressive approaches hold real promise on the road to AGI!

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
2. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
3. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
4. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
5. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
6. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
